# build-blockchain
Software Requirements:
1. You will need a command line application. For MacOS and Linux, I recommend the native Terminal application. Iterm2 is also a good option on MacOS. For Windows, I recommend using the Git Bash shell application.


2. I use NodeJS as the engine to run our JavaScript-based project. Make sure you have Node installed on your system.


I use a tool called Postman. This app allow us to send custom HTTP Requests to our running blockchain servers. 
Here is the link to install Postman: https://www.getpostman.com/docs/postman/launching_postman/installation_and_updates
