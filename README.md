#Build Your Own BlockChain Using Nodejs

#Prerequisites
1. You will need a command line application. For MacOS and Linux, I recommend the native Terminal application. Iterm2 is also a good option on MacOS. For Windows, I recommend using the Git Bash shell application.


2. I use NodeJS as the engine to run our JavaScript-based project. Make sure you have Node and nmp installed on your system.

You could check it running the command
```
$ node -v
v8.11.3 (or something similar)

$nmp -v
5.6.0 (or something similar)
```
I use a tool called Postman. This app allow us to send custom HTTP Requests to our running blockchain servers.
Here is the link to install Postman: https://www.getpostman.com/docs/postman/launching_postman/installation_and_updates
